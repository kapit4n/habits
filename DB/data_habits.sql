Abnormal or irregular eating habit is one of the greatest mistakes that will affect your health. Skipping meals and not eating on time can affect the normal balance of your body functions.

Good Foods For Immune System
Always keep a regular timetable for your food timing. Human body works in a rhythm and all our body functions are following this. When you are not taking food in time, this will result in many metabolic disorders. This will ultimately lead to health issues like diabetes, obesity, heart diseases and digestive disturbances.
In this modern time, when people are working even in night, it is difficult to maintain proper timing for food intake. But, if you are careful about your health, know the importance of eating on time and arrange your meals in proper way.', 1, '2018-09-06 13:33:08', 720, 33);

What’s the most fun way to learn English?

If you’re tired of going to class or reading a book, there’s nothing better than learning English through movies and film.

Is Learning English Through Movies and Film Right For Me?

Learning a foreign language is already hard. And the culture is different from your own. So sometimes, you might have trouble understanding what actors are saying, or what they’re doing on the screen.

So today, I want to share a few tips with you on learning English with movies. They’ll help you learn helpful new words and phrases, but also enjoy watching movies at the same time.

3 Reasons Why Learning English With Movies and Film Works

Perhaps you’re still wondering if you can still really learn any English by watching movies.

After all, watching movies is supposed to be fun, right? So, how can you learn while having so much fun with the film? And more importantly, why should you learn English with movies instead of with textbooks?

Here are three reasons I believe it works, and why I recommend learning the language this way.

1. You’ll get to learn real English…not textbook English.

The English you learn through textbooks or in ESL class is not what you’ll hear people say. For example, in beginner English classes, you might have learnt how to say “it’s a quarter to seven” or “it’s raining cats and dogs”. While these are correct, we almost never say these in real life.

In contrast, the English spoken in movies is very natural. It’s also very close to what you’ll hear if you speak with native English speakers too. This will help improve your spoken English.', 1, '2018-09-06 18:33:50', 1140, 31);

by D. Power
There are many ways to state the benefits of planning or anticipatory decision making. The following claimed benefits are discussed in a number of sources.

1. Planning helps decision makers by providing guidelines and goals for future decisions.

2. Planning helps a manager exercise more control in a situation, establish goals "proactively" and consider contingencies.

3. Planning can help quantify goals and establish a means of measuring success.

4. Planning can help insure that a coherent set of actions are implemented that are consistent with the values and priorities of the decision maker.

5. Planning helps allocate limited resources like staff, materials, and time in an orderly and systematic manner.

KEY POINTS

Planning is a management process concerned with defining goals for a company''s future direction and determining the resources required to achieve those goals. Managers may develop a variety of plans (business plan, marketing plan, etc.) during the planning process.
Achieving a vision requires coordinated efforts that adhere to a broader organizational plan. This is enabled through consistent strategies that are supported by staff at all levels.
Planning enables increased focus on, and coordinated action toward, competitive strategies, while minimizing wasted time and ensuring there are benchmarks for the control process.
Planning typically offers a unique opportunity for information-rich and productively focused discussions between the various managers involved. The plan and the discussions that arise from it provide an agreed context for subsequent management activities.', 1, '2018-08-28 11:15:52', 1200, 28);
