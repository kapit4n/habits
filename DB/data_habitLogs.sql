Read on the find out about Jerry favorite tools when designing system arcihtecture, and what software methodologies he recommends:
When designing the architecture for a new system, what is your thought process?
Break large problems into smaller ones. It sounds simple, but I think this is one of the primary traits needed to architect anything. See the big picture, and then dive deeper. Start with the high-level responsibilities, and continue breaking things down until everything has its purpose.
WHAT TOOLS DO YOU USE WHEN DESIGNING THE SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE FOR A NEW SYSTEM?
I usually start with whiteboard sessions with the entire team and have product managers, QA, operations and developers thrown in opinions. Work toward a high level picture of the system  that everyone can agree upon. Further design sessions happen with just the development team to work out details. Visio is great for UML, database diagrams, flowchats, network topology, etc.
You''ll need different designs depending on the audience (i.e. operations will want machines, network diagrams, firewalls, etc.). Balsamiq is good for mockup UI''s they look as if ther''re drawn by hand - which is great to let everyone get an idea of how things will look. It''s fast to create and simple to change, perfect for early designs.
Working code works great as well! I usually work very closely to create the first pages, services, and tests for the application, These serve as a model for the team moving forward.
AS A SOFTWARE ARCHITECT, WHICH SOFTWARE METHODOLOGY DO YOU PREFER?
Definitely Agile, but in its "pure form" that is light on processes. Focus on solving the user''s problem - everything else is second. I like small iterations (one week) early in the project to make sure everyone stays on the same page, and then two-week iterations as things hit their stride. Agile accepts that change as part of building a system and embrace it.
Automate as much as you can: developer environemtn setup, continuous integrations and continuous delivery if you''re ready for it. Writing the scripts to automate the process serves two purpose: working documentation and a process that is fast and repeatable.
I''m not hardcore TDD, but I think testing is important. Having tests mean you can move quickly, stay flexible, refactor and change as needed. No one person needs to have the entire system in their dead - the tests describe how it''s supposed to work and make sure that it does. Keep an eye on your test times - slow tests and comlicated setups usually mean there are opportunities to improve parts of the code.

A how-to is written as a sequence first you do this, and then you do this. The essential question the writer asks herself when writing a how-to is, "What happens next? If you are about to embark on a how-to, start at what you consider the beginning, and just keep answering that question over and over again. Before you know it, you will have sketched out a draft of a how-to article.

STEP1: SELECT YOUR TOPIC.
Choose a topic interests you enough to focus on it for a least a week or two. If your topic is broad, narrow it. instead of writing about how to decorate your home, try covering how to decorate your home in country style on a shoestring budget. That''s more specific and, as much, easier to tackle.

STEP 2: ADDRESS YOUR AUDIENCE''S NEEDS.
Now, come back to your piece. Switch gears and imagine you''re the reader of this article. Pick three words to describe the audience you want to address.

STEP 3: RESEARCH.
Research will ground you article in fact. Good details to include with your how-to are:
* Statistics.
* Quotes by well-known people
* Definitions
* Anecdotes
* Quotes and examples from people like the reader or from popular books on the subject.
* References to other media (film, television, radio)

STEP 4: TIGHTEN YOUR DRAFT.
Keeping your audience in mind, write a tighter draft incorporating the new supporting information you''ve learned in step 2 and 3 may compel you to start over with a completely fresh draft.

WHY MACHINE LEARNING MATTERS
Artificial intelligence will shape our future more powerfully than any other innovation this century. Anyone who does not understand it will soon find themselves feeling left behind, waking up in a world full of technology that feels more and more like magic.
The rate of acceleration is already astounding. After a couple of AI winters and periods of false hope over the past four decades, rapid advances in data storage and computer processing power have dramatically changed the game in recent years.
In 2015, Google trained a conversational agent (AI) that could not only convincingly interact with humans as tech helpdesk, but also discuss morality, express opinions, and answer general facts-based questions.
The same year deepmind developed and agent that surpassed human-level perfornace at 49 Atari games, receiving only the pixels and game score as inputs. Soon after, in 2016, DeepMind obsoleted their own achievement by releasing a new state-of-the-art gameplay method called A3C.
Meanwhile, AlphaGo defeated on of the bet human players at Go - and extraordinary achievement in a game dominated by humans for two decades after machines first conquered chess. Many masters could not fathom how to would be possible for a machine to grasp the full nuance and complexity of this ancient Chinese ware strategy game, with its 10*170 possible board positions (there are only 10*80 atoms in the universe).

In flux the dispatcher is a singleton that directs the flow of data and ensures that updates do not cascade. As an application grows, the dispatcher becomes more vital, as it can also mnanage dependencies between stores by invoking the registered callbacks in a specific order.

BREEZE: is known as the primary scientific computing for Scala. It scoops up ideas from MATLAB''s data structures and the NumPy classes for Python. Breeze provides fast and efficient manipulations with data arrays, and enables the implementation of many other operations including matrix and vector operations, Probability and statistic functions, Optimization, Linear algebra and signal processing operations.

SADDLE: another data manipulation toolkit for Scala. It is a Scala analog of R and Python''s pandas  library. Like the dataframe in pandas or R, Saddle is based on the Frame structure (2D indexed matrix).

SCALALAB: is a Scala''s interpretation of MATLAB  computing functionality. Moreover, ScalaLab can directly call and accesss the results of MATLAB scripts.

NLP
EPIC, has some great natural language processing libraries as a part of ScalaNLP, including Epic and Puck.

VISUALIZATION
BREEZE-VIZ: is the plotting library developed by Breeze for Scala.

VEGAS: another Scala lib for data visualization is Vegas. It is a much more functional than Breeze-viz and allows to make some plotting specifications such as filtering, transformations, and aggregations. It is similar in structure to Python''s Bokeh and Plotly.

MACHINE LEARNING
SMILE: statistical machine intelligence and learning engine, or shortly Smile, is a promising modern machine learning system in some ways similar to Python''s scikit-learn. It is developed in Java and offers and API for Scala too. The library will amaze you with fast and extensive applications, efficeint memory usage and a large set of machine learning algorithms for Classification, Regression, Nearest Neighbor Search, Feature Selection, etc.

APACHE SPARK MLLIB & ML: Built on top of spark, MLlib library provides a vast variety of machine learning algorithms. Being written in Scala, it also provides highly functional API for Java, Python, and R, but opportunities for Scala are more flexible.

DEEPLEARNING.SCALA: is an alternative machine learning toolkit that provides efficient solutions for deep learning. It utilizes mathematical formulas to create complex dynamic neural networks through a combination of object-oriented and functional programming.

react is a simple, yet powerful, UI library. When it was released in 2013, it offered an alternative to the existing popular monolithic JavaScript frameworks of the time. React''s most important advantages are the emphasis on components, one-way flow, the Virtual DOM, JSX, and architecture that extends beyond HTML.
React''s simplicity lies in that it makes it easy to declare user-interfaces in self-contained independent components.
In React, every UI is a composed of components, so there is no mismatch of multiple types to worry about.
COMPONENTS
The React UI is declared inside components. A component is like a function that accepts props as inputs and outputs the declared interface.
ONE-WAY DATA FLOW
React uses one-way data flow, so only changes to the data result in changes to the UI. If you use Redux, you change data in a global app store, and the components listen for changes there.
VIRTUAL DOM
The Virtual DOM allows the UI to be efficient in diffing UI changes. This in-between process between that the component should render and what the actual rendering is that it allows React to work on different platforms.
ECOSYSTEM
React isn''t just the UI, it''s a framework/ecosystem. You can manage the state using a state manager such as redux. This is abstracted away from the component tree. It makes debugging easier to not have state hidden in multiple places. There are good tools following this stack such as Redux DevTools, which allows you to see the app state as a collapsible tree widget.', '7/30/2018 11:33:05 AM', '7/30/2018 11:33:05 AM');

Breeze is a library for numerical processing. It aims to be generic, clean, and powerful without sacrificing (much) efficiency.

Breeze is modeled on Scala, and so if you''e familiar with it, you''ll be familiar with Breeze. First, import the linear algebra package:

import breeze.linalg._
lets create a vector

val x = DenseVector.zeros[Double](5)
Here we make a column vector of zeros of type Double. And there are other ways we could create the vector - such as with literal DenseVector(1,2,3) or with a call to fill or tabulate. The vector is "dense" because it is backed by an Array[Double], but could as well have created a SparseVector.zeros[Double](5), which would not allocate memory of zeros.

Breeze also supports slicing. Note that slices using a Range are much, much faster those with an arbitrary sequence.
x(3 to 4) := .5

The slice operator constructs a read-thought and write-throught view of the given elements int eh underlying vector. You set its values using the ctorized-set operator :=. You could as well have  set it ot a compatibly sized Vector
x(0 to 1) := DenseVector(.1, .2)

Similarly, a DenseMatrix can be create with a constructro method call, and its elements can be accessed and updated.
val m = DenseMatrix.zeros[Int](5,5)

Feedback:
On this feedback what I found is that 
Weka is a standard java tool for performing both machine learning experiments and for embedding trained models in Java applications. It can be used for supervised and unsupervised learning. There are three way to use weka first using command line, second using Weka GUI, and third through its API with Java. Weka''s library provides a large collection of machine learning algorithms, implemented in Java.
DATASET
Weka uses a data file format called ARFF, with attributes values for each instance being separated by commas.
GENERATING A MODEL
In this stage we generate a model using MultilayerPerceptron (Neural network) to classify iris 2D dataset. I set the defaults values for neural learning process, of course, you can change them manually through setter methods.
This is done by ModelGenerator class which has four methods as described in the next table.
loadDataset, buildClassifier, evaluateModel, saveModel
CLASSIFICATION USING THE GENERATED MODEL
In this stage we use the generated model with ModelGenerator class to classify a new instance.
This is done by ModelClassifier class.

Kotlin is the statically typed language which is having some great features to try out so let''s see those with an example and also how to use kotlin.
Extension function
  fun Int.Multi() = this*50
  print(50.multi())
Hi order function, If your function accepts function as a parameter or returns function as a result that it''s called high order function.
  fun addvalue(operation:(Int, Int) -> Int): Int {
    return operation910, 20);
  }

 addValue{num1, num2 -> num1*num2}

Inter-operable with java; What makes jotlin more interesting is that whateve extra advantage that you have in kotlin it can be used directly in you java code also. If you want to use kotlin class in your java class that just create the object fo that class as you normally create in java.

Null safety, The billon dollar mistake null pointer exception can be easily be avoided with kotlin using "?" operator. The way it works is that it first check for the value if is it nullor not if it''s not null than only it performs the next operation for example.

Smart Cast, It''s quite the best feature that you can ask for that this does is that it check for some type and than it will allow to perform all the operation allowed for that particular type like for example if the type is string it will allow copy, lenght etc operation and on the same object if it detects it''s and integer than it will allow operation done on integer. How do we do that? so fo rthat just use an operator "is" to check for the type.
  val n:Any = "hello"
  when(n) {
    is String -> n.length
   is Int -> n.inc()
Smart cast do not work when the compiler cannot guarantee about the variable change between the check and the usage.
Smart cast work when val is local variable and it is private or internal.

Default and names arguments, Absence of this feature in java makes the developer to add function overloading concept as all the parameter declared has to be passed by the caller but with this feature you can get rip of all these just by giivng the default value to the parameter whom you want to make optional while calling theat method and you are free to use thereafter with no bound on giving values to all the parameter.

Multi-value return from function, There are few scenario where more than 1 value need to be returned form the function, now it''s possible to do that. This is actually called as destructuring declaration.
  data class student(val name:String, val age: Int)
  fun studentsFun(student: Student):Student {
    return student(student.name, student.age)
  }
  val stud = Student("Jhon", 24)

Work thought the tutorial above. It will take you 5 to 10 minutes max.
You do not need to understand everything. Your goals is to run thought the tutorial end to end and get a result. List down your questions as you go. Make heavy use of the help FunctionName help sysntax in Python to learn about all of the functions that you''re using.
You do not need to know how the algorithms work. It is important to know about the limitations and how to configure machine learning algorithms. But learning about algorithms can come later. You need to build up this algorithms knowledge slowly over a long period of time. Today, start off by getting confortable with the platform.

You do not need to be a Python programmer. The syntax of the Python language can be intuitive if you are new to it. Just like other languages, focus on function call. This will get you most of the way. You are a developer, you know how to pick up the basics of a language real fast. Just get starter and dive into the details later.

You do not need to be a machine learning expert. You can learn about the benefits and limitations of various algorithms later, and there a re plenty of posts that can read later to brush up on the steps of a machine learning project and the importance of evaluating accuracy using cross validation.

What about other steps in machine learning project. we did not cover all of the steps in a machine learning project because this is your first project and we need to docus on the key steps. Namely, loading data, locking at the data, evaluating some algorithms and making some predictions. In later tutorials we can looks at other data preparation and result improvement tasks.

The updated React project template provides a convenient starting point for ASP.NET Core apps using React and create-react-app (CRA) conventions to implement a rick client-side user nterface (UI).
The template is equivalent to creating both an ASP.NET Core projects to act as an API backend, and a standard CRA React Project to act as a UI, but with the convenience of hosting both is a single app project that can be built and published as a single unit.
The project template creates an ASP.NET Core app and a react app. The ASP.NET Core app is intended to be used for data access, authorization, and other server-side concerns. The react app, residing in the ClientApp sub-directory, is intended to be used for all UI concerns.

App pages, images, styles, modules. The client directory is standard CRA React App
There a slight differences between the React app created by this template and the one created by CRA itself; however the apps capabilities are unchanged. The app create template contais a bootstrap bases layout and a basic routing example.

Publish and deploy
In development, the app runs in a model optimized for developer convenience. For examle, javaScript bundles include source maps (so that when debugging, you can see your original source code). the app watches javascript, HTML, and CSS files changes on disk and automatically recompliles and reloads when it sees those files change.
In production, serve a version of your app that''s optimized for performance. this is configured to happend automatizally.

No matter what comes to mind when you actually set some time aside and ask yourself what you want, you should think it through.

Don''t make that mistake and waste time going after something that won''t eventually make you happy, even when achieved.

Let today be the day you assess where you are right now, and try to describe where you want to be a year from now in details. Create a picture of the ideal day, who you want to be, what you want to be doing, who else you want around, etc.

Visualize it and see how you feel about each aspect. If something doesn''t excite you, or won''t actually make you feel better or be more successful, maybe it just sounds good but is not worth pursuing.

Make sure you write down 1-3 specific personal goals right now so you have something to work with from here on.

When defining each, use the S.M.A.R.T. technique.

Do goal setting right with one or more of the following goals.
- Start getting things done.
- Embrace mindfulness.
- Travel solo.
- Start exercising.
- Get rid of toxic people.

Constructor injection
Constructor injection is used to declare and obtain dependencies of a service construction.
ProductService is injecting IProductRepository as a dependency in its constructor then using it inside the Delete method.
Good practices, define required dependencies explicitly in the service constructor. Thus, the service can not be constructed without its dependencies.
Assign injected dependency to a read only field/property.
Property Injection, ASP.NET Core standard dependency unjection container does not support property injection. But you can use another container supporting the property injection.
Service Locator
Service locator pattern is another way of obtaining dependencies.

Frameworks make developers'' lives easier by offering them a structure for application development. They automate the implementation of common solutions, cutting development time and allowing developers to focus more on application logic instead of routine elements.
Some things to consider:
When deciding which framework to use, look at the size and complexity of your project. If what you''re looking to develop is a large system packed with features and requirements, a full-stack framework might be the right choice. If your app is on the smaller and simpler side, you whould probably consider a microframework.
FULL STACK FRAMEWORKS

Django
Django is a free open-source full-stack python framework. It tries to include all of the ncessary features by default as apposed to offering them as separate libraries.
Django uses its ORM to map objects to database tables. The same code works with different databases and isn''t difficult to transfer from one database to another. The main databases that Django works with are PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle.

Pyramid
Pyramid is an open-source Python-based web application framework. Its main goal is to do as much as possible with minimum complexity.
The most striking feature of Pyramid is its ability to work with both small and large applications. Some of Pyramid''s great features include: Single-file applications, URL generation, Extensible configuration. All-embracing templating and asset specification, Flexible authentication and authorization, Testing, support and comprehensive data documentation, View predictes and many per-route views, Function decorators, Predicates, renderers.

TurboGears
TurboGears is a open-source, data-driven full-stack web application framework.
It allows you to quickly develop extensible data-driven web applications. TurboGears comes with user-friendly templating and a powerful and flexible ORM.
Some of TurboGears distinctive features include: Multi-database support, MVC-style architecture, Support for SQLObject and SQLAlchemy

Web2py
Web2py is a scalable open-source full-stack framework. However, you should know before reading further that Web2py does not support Python 3.

Secret #1: make sure this is actually something you want to do.
There are few things more frustrating than doing something that has no point in the end.
Motivation is good, but now the answer to keep you going in the long run. Become passionate about what you do.

Secret #2: Start small, celebrate the little things, and build, build, build!
A good mentor of mine told me if you want to create a flying car, then start with making some wheels into a skateboard, enjoy the skateboard and turn that into a bike and so on.
Build a personal low-risk project that tackles a new idea or puts a new twist on a old idea.

Secret #3: Get a mentor
Get training or regular mentoring by and expert in the language of choice or technology you aspire to master

Secret #4: Maintain a portfolio

Secret #5: Just do it. Or just do nothing.
I try to keep in mind that the shortest distance between me and my goal is just to do the damn thing.
Keep in mind that it''s easy to burnout after a few hours of binge-watching tutorials or non-stop programming. It''s important that you allocate some time for getting rest in order to recover and recharge. how knows, maybe you''ll even be able to solve the issue in your dreams. (seriously though, it happens.)

Secret #6: Balance
Sometimes it''s easy to forget that there''s a world outside of your computer, so make sure that your''re consistently taking a break away from your computer (or even from electronics for that matter).
Secret #7: Be a part of a supportive community

When building an application within the specific framework, you need to know the best practices to write clean and maintainable code. We formed Top Angular 5 Best Practices based on our experience.
PROJECT STRUCTURE
In app development, a smooth project structure is a point to pay attention in the first place. There is no completely defined way of building the perfect structure because everything depends on the work.
WRITING COMPONENTS
Components are not the new practice, but it is one of Angular''s a core feature, so we considered to mention it. When components are organized and reusable, it is already half work done.
The angular application architecture is like a tree of components. According to your needs, you can use Container (Smart) or Presentation (Dumb) Components. When you have the component passing properties down to other components, make it Smart.
PERFORMANCE
Angular is quite a fast framework. But due to project expansion, its performance may decrease. There are some ways you can help Angular to process faster. To start you can ChangeDetectionStrategy to onPush. It gives a signal to the Angular that the component only depends on his own Input. Thus, Angular will check it in two cases. When a component or its derivative caused the event or if the Input reference changes.
USE RXJS
RxJS is difficul for understanding. Yet it does its job and simplifies developer''s work. In fifth Angular edition, RxJS has undergone some minor changes. The code remained the same, but RxJS moved to lettable operators. It allowed cutting problems associated with the old mechanishm of data import.
TESTING
Angular 5 has an effective testing tool. Testing enables us to make sure that certain parts of the application work exactly as you expect them to. This to some extent saves the existing code from breakdowns, helps to clarify - how it will work in various cases. And, in the end, allows detecting code weaknesses.

Use native code when you need to, react native combines smoothly with components written in Objective-C, Java, Swift. It''s simple to drop down to native code if you need to optimize a few aspects of you application. It''s also easy to build part of your app in React native, and part of your app using native code directly - that''s how Facebook app works.

Learn the basics, react native is like react, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. So to understand the basic structure of a react native app, you need to understand some of the basic react concepts, like JSX, components, state, and props. If you already know React, you still need to learn some react-native-specific stuff, like the native components.

If you are feeling curious, you can play around with sample code directly in the web simulators. You can also paste it into your App.js firle to create a real app on your local machine.

What''s going on here?
Some of the things in here might not look like JavaScript to you, Don''t panic. This is the future.
First of all. ES2015 (also known as ES6) is set of improvements to JavaScript that is now part of the official standard, but now yet supported by all browsers, so often it isn''t used yet in web development. React native ships with ES2015 support, so you can use this stuff without worrying about compatibility. import, from, class, and extends in the example above are all ES2015 features. If you aren''t familiar with ES2015, you can probably pick it up just by reading through sample code like this tutorial has.
The other unusual thing is this code example is View text Hello World Text View. This is JSX - a syntax for embedding XML withing JavaScript Many frameworks use a special templating language which lets you embed code inside markup language. In react, this is reversed. JSX lets you write your markup language inside code. It looks lik HTML on the web, excepts instead of web things like div or span, you use react components. In this case Text is a built-in component that just displays some text and View is like the div or span.

Components, so this code defining HelloWorldApp, a new Component, When your''re building a react native app, you''ll be making new components a lot. Anything you see on the screen is some sort of components. A component can be pretty simple - the only thing that''s required is a render function which returns some JSX to render.

So you want o be able to build mobile apps for both Android and IOS. Should you learn the individual native languages for each app (for Android means java and for ios means swift/objetive-c)? Or should you learn javascript to use hybrid framework react native? There are lots of considerations to take: your existing coding skills, the purpose of your app, and the lngevity of the project. Here, Aditya Narayan of mobile bootcamp TurnToTech digs in deep and shared what it takes to build native versus using react native apps for android and iOS.

React first came out as a way to build user interfaces for the web using JavaScript. It''s like any other framework that comes with its tools and best practices except that this one''s from facebook bring something useful and react brought a clean style to UI development based on the simple idea that the user intergace is a function of data - if the data changes, UI should change.

Why are developers choosing between react native vs native android ios development?, There are two main reasons.
1. React native comes with a big bonus - you could develop an app in React Native and deploy it on both iOS and Android.

Being an open source platform, it is actively used for projects within the corporation and number of well-know world-class services (SoundCloud, Netflix, Dropbox)

In 2014, I gave a talk at the inaugural GophenCon titled Best practices in production environments. We were early adopters at soundCould, and by that point had been writing, running, and maintaining Go in production in one for or another for nearly 2 years. We had learning few things, and I tried to distill and convey some of those lessors.
DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT, Go has development environment conventions centered around the GOPATH. In 2014 I advocated strongly for a single global GOPATH. My positioned has softened a bit. I still think that''s the best idea, all else equal, but depending on your project or team, other things may make sense, too.
Put $GoPath/bin in your $PATH, so installed binaries are easily accessible.
REPOSITORY STRUCTURE, We''ve had a lot of time for projects to mature, and some patterns have emerged. While I believe there is not single best repo structure, I think there is a good general model for many types of project. It''s especially useful for projects that provide both binary and libraries, or combine Go code with other, non-Go assets.
The basic idea is to have two top-level directories, pkg and cmd. Underneath pkg, create directories for each of your binaries. all of your go code should live exclusively in on of these locations.
Put library code under a pkg/ subrirectory. Put binary under a cmd/ subdirectory.
Always use fully-qualified import paths. Never user relative imports.

FORMATTING AND STYLE
Things have stayed largely the same here. This is one area that Go has gotten quite right, and I really appreciate the consensus in the community and stability in the language.

If you want to become a software engineer, but don''t know where to start, let''s save you the suspense: it''s algorithms and data structures.
SEARCHING
Roughly speaking, there are two categories of search algorithms you''ll need to know right away: linear and binary.. Depth First Search(DFS) and Breath First Search (BFS) are also super-important, but we''ll save them for the graph traversal section below.
Linear search, the linear and binary algorithms are names as such to describe how log (time complexity) a search is going to take based on the size of the input that is being search.
Binary search, it gets its name because the word binary means "of or relating to 2 things" and the algorithm works by splitting the input into two parts it finds the item that is being searched. One half contains the search item and the other half doesn''t. The process continues until the spot where the input is split becomes the item that is beign searched. Binary search is basically just a highly disciplined approach to the process of elimination. It''s faster than linear search, but it only world with ordered sequences.
SORTING
Ordering, otherwise know as sorting, list of items is one of the most common programming tasks you''ll do as developer. Here we look at two of the most useful sorting algorithms: MergeSort and QuickSort.

The best way to learn RN is to understand what mobile development is. Know the basic concepts, such as Drawer, Toolbar, TabBar, ViewPager or Button.
This also includes concepts such as stack. Push things on the stack and popping them from time to time.
There is a similarity between startActivity and navigator.push()

Steps to follow:
- Start by reading the getting started tutorial and try to run it on your machine. It''s the first thing to do.
- Read about the components specs and lifecycle in React. RN comes from ReactJS, they have a lot of things in common and understanding things like componentDidMount() or componentWillMount() will help a lot.
- Then read Pete Hunt''s tutorial about ReactJS. You need to understand what component are and now they are implemented.
- Go to other sample apps, all of them. Read code and when you don''t understand something, just Google it. If you want to see how an app need to be structured in the proper way, you may want to have a look at the Facebook* App.
- You need something to start with. You learn by coding (and readin), not just reading or (even worse) watching. Why don''t you try to implement Instagram? Tinder could be another idea.
- go to https://rnplay.org/ and create an example

Maybe you know it... But I didn''t know it.
Updated-Deep Learning is an attempt to copy the pattern detection ability of a human brain, the main cause of pattern detection is Neural Networks in our brain.

What is a tensor?
It is just a general term of unit of data. Duh... we all know it...
It is also represented with a Rank, Like in matrix. They are geometric objects that describe linear relations between geometric vectors, scalars, and other tensor.
A tensor consists of a set of primitive values shaped into an array of any number of dimensions.

But which type of data, Scalar or Vector?
If you think like me, that it is an upgrade of vectors like vectors is an upgrade to scalars. Then no, you are wrong. Both the quantities Scalar and Vector are Tensors.

What is a Rank or Tensor''s Rank?
The number of dimensions used to represent the data is known as its Ranks.

Gang of four design patterns

Creational Design Patterns
Abstract factory, allows for the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type.
Factory method, creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
Prototype, creates a new object from an existing object.
Singleton, ensures only one instance of an object is created.

Structural design patterns
Adapter, allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an instance around one of the existing classes.
Bridge, decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.
Composite, takes a group of objects into a single object.
Decorator, allows for an object''s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.
Facade, provides a single interface to a more complex underlying object.
Flyweight, reduces the cost of complex object models.
Proxy, provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.

Behavior Design Patterns
Chain of responsibility, delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
Command, creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
Interpreter, implements a specialized language.
Iterator, accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
Mediator, allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
Memento, provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
Observer, is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
State, allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
Strategy, allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on the fly at run-time.
Template method, defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.
Visitor, separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
